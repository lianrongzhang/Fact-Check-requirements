        "result": "### Analysis of Claim:\n\n- Key Information from Context:\nThe context includes articles from The New York Times and ABS-CBN, as well as a profile page on Science Feedback, an organization that reviews and rates scientific content. The claim is stated in multiple sources: \"Global warming is driving polar bears towards extinction.\"\n\n### Step-by-Step Evaluation:\n\n1. Evidence 1:\n- Observation: According to the article from The New York Times published by ABS-CBN on July 21, 2020, global warming is driving polar bears towards extinction.\n- Reasoning: This evidence supports the claim, as it directly states that global warming is threatening the long-term survival of polar bears.\n\n2. Evidence 2:\n- Observation: A study reviewed by Science Feedback confirms that the decline in Arctic sea ice coverage is having a devastating impact on polar bear populations.\n- Reasoning: This evidence also supports the claim, as it highlights the urgent need for conservation efforts to protect polar bears due to the loss of sea ice.\n\n3. Evidence 3:\n- Observation: Andrew Derocher, a professor at the University of Alberta with expertise on polar bears, has reviewed several claims related to polar bears and climate change.\n- Reasoning: His feedback on these claims includes one that states the long-term survival of polar bears is threatened by loss of sea-ice due to global warming (rated \"Correct\"). This provides additional support for the claim.\n\n### Additional Analysis:\nConsidering multiple pieces of evidence, it becomes clear that there is a consensus among scientific sources that global warming is driving polar bears towards extinction. The decline in Arctic sea ice coverage and its impact on polar bear populations are well-documented concerns.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n- Claim Status: Supported\n- Language: English\n- Date: 2020-07-21 (ABS-CBN) and no specific date mentioned for the study reviewed by Science Feedback, but the article was published in July 2020.\n- Country: None specified, as this is an international scientific consensus.\n- URL:\nhttps://www.abs-cbn.com/overseas/07/21/20/global-warming-is-driving-polar-bears-toward-extinction\nhttps://science.feedback.org/review/the-long-term-survival-of-polar-bears-is-threatened-by-loss-of-sea-ice-due-to-global-warming-new-study-confirms-henry-fountain/\nhttps://science.feedback.org/member/andrew-derocher/",

        "claim": "The sun has gone into ‘lockdown’ which could cause freezing weather, earthquakes and famine, say scientists",
        "result": "### Analysis of Claim:\n\n- Key Information from Context:\nThe context suggests that the claim \"The sun has gone into 'lockdown' which could cause freezing weather, earthquakes and famine, say scientists\" is related to a solar minimum event. The article provides evidence that Dr. Tony Phillips did not provide an interview to The Sun and instead shared accurate information about the solar minimum on his website, Spaceweather.com. Additionally, scientists predict that the 2019-2020 solar minimum would be similar to the last one, with no catastrophic effects.\n\n### Step-by-Step Evaluation:\n\n1. Evidence 1:\n- Observation: An investigation by Snopes found that The Sun's report was sensationalized and misleading.\n- Reasoning: This evidence refutes the claim, as it suggests that the source of the information is unreliable. Additionally, the investigation found no evidence to support the catastrophic claims made in the article.\n\n2. Evidence 2:\n- Observation: A review by scientists at Science Feedback found that claims about the impact of low solar activity on Earth's climate are misleading.\n- Reasoning: This evidence also refutes the claim, as it suggests that low solar activity has little effect on Earth's climate and that human activities such as burning fossil fuels and deforestation are the main drivers of global warming.\n\n### Additional Analysis:\nConsidering multiple pieces of evidence, it appears that both Snopes and Science Feedback investigated the claim and found it to be misleading or sensationalized. This suggests that the claim is not supported by reliable sources.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n- Claim Status: Refuted\n- Language: The original language of the claim and context.\n- Date: Not specified in the provided context.\n- Country: Not specified in the provided context, but relevant to global climate change.\n- URL: https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/sun-lockdown/ (Snopes investigation) and https://science.feedback.org/review/low-solar-activity-has-little-effect-on-earths-climate-contrary-to-claim-in-the-sun/ (Science Feedback review)",

        "result": "### Analysis of Claim:\n\n- Key Information from Context: The provided context discusses the global polar bear population and its supposed increase despite climate change. Experts from the Polar Bear Specialist Group, Science Feedback, and the US Geological Survey (USGS) have disputed this claim, suggesting that improved tracking methods rather than an actual increase in population are responsible for the rising tally.\n\n### Step-by-Step Evaluation:\n\n1. Evidence 1: \n- Observation: The article on Science Feedback reviews a PragerU video claim that the global polar bear population has increased substantially despite climate change.\n- Reasoning: This evidence refutes the claim, as it suggests that many polar bear populations are declining due to the loss of sea ice caused by climate change.\n\n2. Evidence 2: \n- Observation: According to the reviewers (Ian Stirling and Andrew Derocher), the global polar bear population is not increasing as claimed. Instead, many polar bear populations are declining.\n- Reasoning: This evidence also refutes the claim, providing additional support for the idea that the polar bear population is declining.\n\n3. Evidence 3: \n- Observation: The USGS reports suggest that if sea ice continues to decline, the polar bear population will likely continue to decline as well.\n- Reasoning: This evidence reinforces the notion that the loss of sea ice has a direct impact on the polar bear population and supports the claim's refutation.\n\nAdditional Analysis:\nThe overwhelming consensus among experts is that the global polar bear population is not increasing but rather declining due to climate change. While there may be some variation in tracking methods, the general trend suggests a decline in polar bear populations.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n- Claim Status: Refuted\n- Language: English\n- Date: Not specified\n- Country: US\n- URL: https://science.feedback.org/tag/polar-bears/",

Evidence 1: Review on Science Feedback Platform\n- Observation: The review states that the claim is misleading and inaccurate, and instead finds that anthropogenic CO2 emissions overall cause global warming.\n- Reasoning: This evidence directly refutes the claim, providing a credible source (Science Feedback) that counters the idea of CO2 emissions cooling the planet.\n\n2. Evidence 2: Contextual Information about Climate History\n- Observation: The context mentions that temperatures have fluctuated throughout Earth's history, and that current levels of temperature and CO2 are lower than they have been in the past.\n- Reasoning: This evidence provides a broader context for understanding climate fluctuations, which may help support the review's conclusion that anthropogenic CO2 emissions cause global warming.\n\n### Additional Analysis:\n\nAs the claim is refuted by credible sources (Science Feedback), it appears that there is no further evidence needed to determine the claim's status. The review on the Science Feedback platform directly addresses the claim and provides a contradictory view, making it clear that the claim \"CO2 emissions are cooling the planet\" is not supported.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n- Claim Status: Refuted\n- Language: English\n- Date: No specific date mentioned (YYYY-MM-DD)\n- Country: Not relevant (since Science Feedback is an international platform)\n- URL: https://science.feedback.org/review/claim-that-co2-is-cooling-the-planet-is-misleading-anthropogenic-co2-emissions-overall-cause-global-warming/",

Evidence 1:  \n- Observation: The Global Carbon Budget 2019 study found that human activities released approximately 43 billion metric tons of CO2 into the atmosphere in 2019.\n- Reasoning: This evidence supports the claim that human activities have significantly increased atmospheric CO2 levels, which is a crucial factor in the global carbon cycle and climate change.\n\n2. Evidence 2:  \n- Observation: The review highlights that the natural carbon cycle is not capable of absorbing the excess CO2 emitted by human activities.\n- Reasoning: This evidence also supports the claim that human activities have significantly increased atmospheric CO2 levels, as it emphasizes the inability of the natural carbon cycle to absorb the excess emissions.\n\n### Additional Analysis:  \nThe provided context does not contain direct evidence supporting or refuting the specific claim.

The claim suggests that human activity through fossil fuel burning is the primary force controlling earth temperatures.\n\n### Step-by-Step Evaluation:\n\n1. Evidence 1:\n- Observation: Kamala Harris' climate policies and positions on various climate-related issues.\n- Reasoning: According to the article, Kamala Harris believes that climate change is largely driven by human activity, including the burning of fossil fuels. This evidence supports the claim.\n\n2. Evidence 2:\n- Observation: Comparison of Vice President Kamala Harris' and former President Donald Trump's stances on climate change.\n- Reasoning: The article highlights that Kamala Harris believes climate change is making disasters such as hurricanes, wildfires, and heatwaves more intense, which is consistent with the claim. In contrast, Donald Trump has mocked the threat of sea-level rise and dismissed concerns about combating climate change.\n\n### Additional Analysis:\n- Integrating multiple pieces of evidence, it can be concluded that various scientific sources, including politicians like Kamala Harris, agree that human activity through fossil fuel burning is a significant contributor to climate change.

        "claim": "Volcanoes Melting West Antarctic Glaciers, Not Global Warming",
        "result": "### Analysis of Claim:\n\n- Key Information from Context:  \nThe context discusses multiple sources that contradict the claim \"Volcanoes Melting West Antarctic Glaciers, Not Global Warming.\" The articles highlight climate change as the primary driver of glacier melting in Antarctica.\n\n### Step-by-Step Evaluation:\n\n1. Evidence 1:\n   - Observation: A study published in 2018 found that rising sea levels and surface temperatures during the last glacial termination drove grounding-line retreat through regions currently occupied by the Ronne and Ross ice shelves.\n   - Reasoning: This evidence contradicts the claim, as it suggests that climate change is responsible for the melting of West Antarctic glaciers, rather than volcanic activity.\n\n2. Evidence 2:\n   - Observation: A study discovered 91 previously unknown volcanoes beneath the ice in western Antarctica, raising concerns about the stability of Antarctica's ice sheet.\n   - Reasoning: This evidence does not directly support or refute the claim, as it highlights the potential for future eruptions to accelerate melting processes. However, it emphasizes the complex and interconnected nature of climate change, volcanism, and glaciology in Antarctica.\n\n3. Evidence 3:\n   - Observation: Multiple experts confirm that while volcanic activity is responsible for some glacier melting in Antarctica, the main sources of melting are atmospheric and oceanic heat linked to human-induced climate change.\n   - Reasoning: This evidence directly refutes the claim, as it indicates that volcanic activity has no significant impact on glacier mass loss.\n\n4. Evidence 4:\n   - Observation: NASA reports that the Antarctic ice sheet has lost over 2 trillion metric tons of ice since 2002 due to ocean and atmospheric warming, as well as other climate changes attributable to human activity.\n   - Reasoning: This evidence directly supports the claim that climate change is responsible for glacier melting in Antarctica.\n\n5. Evidence 5:\n   - Observation: Geoscientists and oceanographers provide evidence suggesting volcanism has a very small or no effect on ice melt.\n   - Reasoning: This evidence further refutes the claim, as it suggests that volcanic activity does not contribute significantly to glacier melting in Antarctica.\n\nAdditional Analysis:\nThe context highlights multiple studies and expert opinions emphasizing climate change as the primary driver of glacier melting in Antarctica. The evidence presented contradicts the claim \"Volcanoes Melting West Antarctic Glaciers, Not Global Warming.\"\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n- Claim Status: Refuted\n- Language: English\n- Date: YYYY-MM-DD (contextual)\n- Country: US (USA)\n- URL: [https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/factcheck/2023/12/19/false-claim-only-volcanos-responsible-for-antarctic-melt-fact-check/71876036007/, https://www.nasa.gov/]",

        "claim": "the bushfires [in Australia] were caused by arsonists and a series of lightning strikes, not 'climate change'",
        "result": "### Analysis of Claim:\n\n- Key Information from Context:\nThe provided context discusses the role of climate change and arson in Australia's bushfires. The main points are that climate change is a significant factor contributing to the severity of the fires, with rising temperatures and changing weather patterns creating conditions conducive to extreme fire behavior.\n\n### Step-by-Step Evaluation:\n\n1. Evidence 1: \n- Observation: Dr. Matthew Jones states that human activities and climate change drive factors behind Australia's bushfires.\n- Reasoning: This evidence supports the claim that climate change is a significant factor in the severity of the bushfires, but it does not directly contradict the claim that arsonists and lightning strikes are the primary causes.\n\n2. Evidence 2:\n- Observation: Dr. Stefan Doerr emphasizes that the frequency and intensity of bushfires are increasing due to climate change.\n- Reasoning: This evidence also supports the claim that climate change is a significant factor in the severity of the bushfires, but it does not provide direct evidence against the claim that arsonists and lightning strikes are the primary causes.\n\n3. Evidence 3:\n- Observation: The Australian Government's Bureau of Meteorology has predicted that conditions associated with pyrocumulonimbus cloud formation could become more prevalent in southeast Australia.\n- Reasoning: This evidence indirectly supports the claim that climate change is a significant factor in the severity of the bushfires by predicting changing weather patterns conducive to extreme fire behavior.\n\n4. Evidence 4:\n- Observation: Jennifer Marlon, a research scientist at Yale School of Forestry & Environmental Studies, stated that \"there are fingerprints of climate change in all of these blazes.\"\n- Reasoning: This evidence directly supports the claim that climate change is a significant factor in the severity of the bushfires by indicating a causal link between climate change and the occurrence of the fires.\n\n### Additional Analysis:\nThe evidence presented suggests that climate change plays a significant role in the severity of Australia's bushfires. While there may be individual instances where arsonists or lightning strikes contribute to fire start-ups, the overall pattern suggests that climate change is an underlying driver of the increasing frequency and intensity of these events.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n- Claim Status: Refuted\n- Language: English\n- Date: Not specified\n- Country: AU\n- URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212094718301454",

        "result": "### Analysis of Claim:\n\n- Key Information from Context:\nThe context discusses an article about volcanic CO2 emissions being significantly smaller than human-caused emissions, citing scientific studies and emphasizing that while volcanoes do release some CO2, this is not a significant contributor to climate change.\n\n### Step-by-Step Evaluation:\n\n1. Evidence 1: The Science Feedback webpage on James Edward Kamis' reviewed content.\n   - Observation: The webpage lists several reviews conducted on content written by James Edward Kamis, including one that states massive volcanic CO2 emissions discredit global warming theory, which is deemed \"Inaccurate\".\n   - Reasoning: This evidence suggests that the claim of massive volcanic CO2 emissions discrediting global warming theory has been previously reviewed and found to be inaccurate.\n\n2. Evidence 2: The Science Feedback webpage on Tobias Fischer's reviewed content.\n   - Observation: The webpage evaluates two climate-related claims made by Tobias Fischer, including one stating that volcanic CO2 emissions are much larger than human-caused emissions, which is deemed \"Inaccurate\".\n   - Reasoning: This evidence confirms the accuracy of the statement that volcanic CO2 emissions are significantly smaller than human-caused emissions.\n\n3. Evidence 3: The Science Feedback review on Principia Scientific's reviewed content.\n   - Observation: The review debunks a claim made by Principia Scientific stating that one volcanic eruption (Mt. Etna) has released more CO2 into the atmosphere than all of humanity's activities since the Earth was formed, which is deemed \"Inaccurate\".\n   - Reasoning: This evidence further supports the accuracy of the statement that volcanic CO2 emissions are significantly smaller than human-caused emissions.\n\n### Additional Analysis:\nConsidering multiple pieces of evidence and context, it is clear that there is no credible support for the claim that massive volcanic CO2 emissions discredit global warming theory. The reviewed content on Science Feedback's website highlights inaccuracies in similar claims, confirming that volcanic CO2 emissions are indeed significantly smaller than human-caused emissions.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n- Claim Status: Refuted\n- Language: English\n- Date: Not specified\n- Country: US (based on the URL provided)\n- URL: https://sciencefeedback.org/outlet/principia-scientific/, https://sciencefeedback.org/review/review-climate-the-movie-the-cold-truth-reveals-numerous-well-known-misinformation-talking-points-inaccuracies/",

        "claim": "Harvard study finds that wind turbines create MORE global warming than the fossil fuels they eliminate",
        "result": "### Analysis of Claim:\n\n- Key Information from Context:  \nThe provided context discusses two separate articles that aim to correct misinformation about wind turbines and their environmental impacts. The claim we are evaluating states that Harvard study finds that wind turbines create MORE global warming than fossil fuels they eliminate.\n\n### Step-by-Step Evaluation:\n\n1. Evidence 1: Summary of the article \"False Claim Has Been Circulating\"  \n- Observation: The article debunks a false claim that wind turbines generate more global warming than fossil fuels, despite relying on a study from Harvard.\n- Reasoning: This evidence directly refutes the claim that wind turbines create more global warming than fossil fuels. It highlights that the Harvard study actually concludes that wind power beats fossil fuels in terms of long-term environmental impacts per unit of energy generated.\n\n2. Evidence 2: Article \"Wind Turbines Claim Is a Load of Hot Air\"  \n- Observation: The article from Australian Associated Press (AAP) debunks another claim that wind turbines are not effective due to the \"load of hot air\" they generate.\n- Reasoning: This evidence further supports the original statement's refutation by providing an alternative perspective on wind turbine operation. It highlights that wind turbines use blades to convert wind energy into electrical energy, which is then fed into the power grid.\n\n3. Evidence 3: Harvard Study (Referenced in both articles)  \n- Observation: The study from Nature Climate Change found that large-scale solar energy installations can cause regional changes in climate, including cooling and changes in precipitation patterns.\n- Reasoning: Although this evidence does not directly address wind turbines, it provides context about the environmental impacts of renewable energy sources. This study highlights a local trade-off between wind power and other low-carbon energy technologies, emphasizing that wind power beats fossil fuels in terms of long-term environmental impacts per unit of energy generated.\n\nAdditional Analysis:  \nConsidering the cumulative evidence from these articles and the referenced Harvard study, it becomes clear that there is no scientific basis for the claim that wind turbines create more global warming than fossil fuels. The studies and articles provide robust data and arguments against this claim, demonstrating that wind power has a lower environmental impact per unit of energy generated.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n- Claim Status: Refuted\n- Language: English\n- Date: Not specified\n- Country: None (as it is an international scientific concept)\n- URL: https://science.feedback.org/review/false-claim-wind-turbines-generate-more-global-warming-than-fossil-fuels-misrepresents-study-ethan-huff/, https://www.aap.com.au/factcheck/wind-turbines-claim-is-a-load-of-hot-air/",

        "result": "### Analysis of Claim:\n\n- Key Information from Context:  \nThe provided context suggests that a popular meme claims to show how melting ice from global warming cannot cause sea-level rise, comparing two images of measuring cups with water and ice.\n\n### Step-by-Step Evaluation:\n\n1. Evidence 1: According to USA Today's investigation (https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/factcheck/2022/06/28/fact-check-measuring-cup-meme-misrepresents-causes-sea-level-rise/7629798001/), sea-level rise occurs when water from melting land-based ice sheets and glaciers pours into the ocean, adding more water than previously contained and raising sea levels. Additionally, global warming causes ocean water to expand as it heats up, further contributing to sea-level rise.\n\n- Observation: The evidence highlights that sea-level rise is a well-established scientific fact, not directly related to the melting of individual icebergs.\n- Reasoning: This evidence suggests that the claim is false, as the meme's comparison between a single iceberg melting and ocean level remaining the same does not accurately represent the process of sea-level rise.\n\n2. Evidence 2: A Washington Post article (https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2021/01/25/ice-melt-quickens-greenland-glaciers/) reports that the West Antarctic ice sheet is at risk of collapse, which could lead to a significant increase in global sea levels.\n\n- Observation: The evidence shows that melting ice sheets can contribute to rising sea levels.\n- Reasoning: This evidence supports the claim's underlying assumption that melting ice can impact sea-level rise. However, it does not directly address the claim's specific statement about ocean level remaining the same when an iceberg melts.\n\n### Additional Analysis:\n\nBy considering multiple pieces of evidence and contextual factors, we can further analyze the claim. The context suggests that the meme is attempting to downplay the effects of global warming on sea-level rise. However, the evidence provided reveals that sea-level rise is a complex process involving the melting of land-based ice sheets and glaciers, as well as ocean expansion.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n- Claim Status: Refuted\n- Language: [English]\n- Date: [2022-06-28]\n- Country: US\n- URL: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/factcheck/2022/06/28/fact-check-measuring-cup-meme-misrepresents-causes-sea-level-rise/7629798001/",

        "result": "### Analysis of Claim:\n\n- Key Information from Context:\nThe context provides several key points relevant to the claim that sea level at Sydney Harbour has risen approximately 0.0 cm over the past 140 years. The articles reviewed by Science Feedback, Verificat, and Snopes examine the claim that sea levels have remained constant at Sydney Harbour over the past century. They present evidence from scientific data, satellite measurements, coastal erosion, and changes in ice sheets and glaciers to support the conclusion that sea levels have been rising.\n\n### Step-by-Step Evaluation:\n\n1. Evidence 1: Scientific Data\n- Observation: According to the review by Science Feedback, sea-level rise has been a long-term trend observed by scientists since the early 20th century.\n- Reasoning: This evidence supports the claim that sea level at Sydney Harbour has risen over the past 140 years. The observation of a long-term trend in sea-level rise suggests that the sea level has indeed increased during this period.\n\n2. Evidence 2: Satellite Measurements\n- Observation: Satellites have been monitoring sea levels since the 1990s, and these measurements confirm the continued rise in sea levels.\n- Reasoning: This evidence also supports the claim that sea level at Sydney Harbour has risen over the past 140 years. The data from satellite measurements provide a reliable and consistent record of sea-level changes.\n\n3. Evidence 3: Coastal Erosion\n- Observation: Coastal erosion is observed to be occurring at Fort Denison, a small island in Sydney Harbour.\n- Reasoning: This evidence suggests that sea level at Sydney Harbour has indeed risen over the past 140 years, as the erosion of the island can be attributed to changes in sea level.\n\n4. Evidence 4: Changes in Ice Sheets and Glaciers\n- Observation: Changes in ice sheets and glaciers are observed to contribute to sea-level rise.\n- Reasoning: This evidence further supports the claim that sea level at Sydney Harbour has risen over the past 140 years, as changes in ice sheets and glaciers can cause a rise in sea levels.\n\n### Additional Analysis:\nThe multiple pieces of evidence presented above provide strong support for the claim that sea level at Sydney Harbour has risen approximately 0.0 cm over the past 140 years. The scientific data, satellite measurements, coastal erosion, and changes in ice sheets and glaciers all point to an increase in sea level during this period.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n- Claim Status: Supported\n- Language: English\n- Date: Not specified (but relevant articles were reviewed)\n- Country: AU (Australia)\n- URL: [1] https://science.feedback.org/, [2] https://www.snopes.com, [3] https://www.aap.com.au",

        "result": "### Analysis of Claim:\n\n- Key Information from Context:\nThe context discusses climate change and human activities as a primary cause of global warming. It highlights scientific consensus among experts, carbon dioxide levels, fossil fuel emissions, and climate models to demonstrate the overwhelming evidence supporting the claim that climate change is caused by humans.\n\n### Step-by-Step Evaluation:\n\n1. Evidence 1: Carbon dioxide levels\n- Observation: According to NASA, carbon dioxide levels are now more than 50% higher than pre-industrial levels.\n- Reasoning: This evidence supports the claim that human activities have significantly contributed to the increase in atmospheric CO2. The observed increase in CO2 levels is consistent with the expected outcome of fossil fuel emissions and land use changes.\n\n2. Evidence 2: Fossil fuel emissions\n- Observation: Humans have emitted over 1 trillion metric tons of CO2 into the atmosphere since 1850, according to the 2022 Global Carbon Budget.\n- Reasoning: This evidence also supports the claim that human activities are a primary cause of global warming. The magnitude of fossil fuel emissions is consistent with the expected outcome of human-driven climate change.\n\n3. Evidence 3: Climate models\n- Observation: Climate models accurately simulate the observed warming trend and can predict future changes.\n- Reasoning: This evidence further supports the claim that climate change is caused by humans. The accuracy of climate models in simulating past trends and predicting future changes demonstrates a strong correlation between human activities and global warming.\n\n### Additional Analysis:\n\nThe context also highlights scientific consensus among experts, which reinforces the claim that climate change is primarily caused by humans. Additionally, the discussion on Germany's carbon footprint and its historical role in industrialization emphasizes the country's moral responsibility to reduce emissions, further supporting the overall conclusion.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n- Claim Status: Supported\n- Language: English\n- Date: N/A (general context)\n- Country: DE (Germany), US (NASA), global (Global Carbon Budget)\n- URL: https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/artificial_earth.view.html, https://www.icosdp.com/en/global-carbon-budget/, and others",

The article concludes that there is no conclusive evidence to link climate change to increased tornado severity or frequency.\n\n### Step-by-Step Evaluation:\n\n1. Evidence 1: \n- Observation: A fact-checking organization, FactCheck.org, evaluated a claim made by Donald Trump stating that \"climate change used to be called 'global warming', then was referred to as 'climate change', and now it's being called 'extreme weather'\". The organization found this claim to be FALSE.\n- Reasoning: This evidence does not directly support or refute the claim that climate change is making extreme weather events, including tornadoes, worse. However, it suggests that the terminology used in discussing climate-related issues has evolved over time and may have implications for how we understand and address these topics.\n\n2. Evidence 2:\n- Observation: A review of claims made by Senator Bernie Sanders and Lord Lawson found that their statements about climate change's impact on tornadoes were deemed \"inaccurate\" as there is no published research supporting these claims.\n- Reasoning: This evidence directly supports the claim that there is no conclusive evidence to link climate change to increased tornado severity or frequency. The review of scientific papers by various scientists and organizations suggests that other factors, such as changes in atmospheric circulation patterns and wind shear, may be more important drivers of tornado variability than global warming.\n\nAdditional Analysis:\n- Considering multiple pieces of evidence and the context provided, it appears that there is no conclusive evidence to support or refute the claim that climate change is making extreme weather events, including tornadoes, worse.

They argued that this claim needs some clarification, pointing out differences in the scale and duration of cow and car emissions.\n\n### Step-by-Step Evaluation:\n\n1. Evidence 1: Cow Emissions vs. Car Emissions\n- Observation: The reviewers note that while cows emit methane, a potent greenhouse gas, the total amount of carbon dioxide equivalent (GtCO2e) emitted by cars is actually higher than that emitted by cows.\n- Reasoning: This evidence supports the claim that cow emissions are not necessarily worse for the climate than car emissions. The context suggests that the scale and duration of emissions play a crucial role in determining their impact.\n\n2. Evidence 2: Timescale Considerations\n- Observation: Ilissa Ocko and Steven Smith point out that car emissions are spread over many years and miles driven, whereas cow emissions are concentrated in smaller areas.\n- Reasoning: This evidence further supports the claim by highlighting the importance of considering different timescales when evaluating emissions. The context implies that if we focus solely on a short-term perspective, cow emissions might appear more significant.\n\n3. Evidence 3: Trend Analysis\n- Observation: The reviewers mention that while cows emit more methane per head than cars do, the number of cows has been declining globally due to population growth and changing diets.\n- Reasoning: This evidence suggests that the overall impact of cow emissions is decreasing over time, which might reduce their relative contribution to climate change.\n\n### Additional Analysis:\n\nConsidering multiple pieces of evidence and contextual factors, it appears that the claim \"Burping cows are more damaging to the climate than all the cars on this planet\" requires clarification. The reviewers' analysis highlights differences in scale and duration between cow and car emissions, as well as changes in cow populations over time. These factors might affect our understanding of which type of emission has a greater impact on the climate.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n- Claim Status: Not Enough Information\n- Language: English\n- Date: 2024\n- Country: None (global context)\n- URL: https://science.feedback.org/reviewed-content-author/barclays/",

Evidence 1: \n- Observation: The article presents a summary of scientific views on this topic, stating that scientists believe warmer ocean temperatures and higher levels of moisture in the atmosphere due to global warming could have intensified the storm's rainfall.\n- Reasoning: This evidence supports the claim that aspects of Hurricane Harvey suggest global warming is making a bad situation worse. It suggests that climate change may have contributed to the intensity of the storm's rainfall.\n\n2. Evidence 2:\n- Observation: The review article \"The Atlantic Accurately Explores Climate Context for Tropical Storm Harvey\" states that the storm's rapid intensification was remarkable, and it is likely that the warmth of the surface and subsurface waters, primarily linked to natural variability but also with a small climate change contribution, enhanced the storm.\n- Reasoning: This evidence also supports the claim, as it suggests that climate change may have played a role in enhancing the storm's intensity.\n\nAdditional Analysis:\nThe analysis acknowledges the complexities involved in attributing extreme weather events to climate change.

The claim that Trump's action could push the Earth over the brink to become like Venus, with a temperature of 250°C and raining sulphuric acid, is not explicitly mentioned in the context. However, we can evaluate similar claims made by Stephen Hawking about Earth becoming a \"hothouse\" like Venus.\n\n### Step-by-Step Evaluation:\n\n1. Evidence from Document 2:\n- Observation: The article reviews a claim made by Stephen Hawking that Earth is at risk of becoming a \"hothouse\" like Venus.\n- Reasoning: According to the reviewers, this claim is incorrect. They point out that the conditions necessary for a runaway greenhouse effect, such as massive amounts of CO2 in the atmosphere and a strong solar radiation flux, do not exist on Earth. Additionally, they note that even if all available fossil fuels were burned, it would only lead to a temporary increase in temperatures, but not to a catastrophic scenario like Venus.\n\n2.

Evidence 1:\n- Observation: According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) fifth assessment report, it is \"extremely likely\" (at least 95% probable) that more than half of the observed temperature increase since the mid-20th century is due to human activity.\n- Reasoning: This evidence suggests that human activities are a significant factor in climate change, which contradicts Perry's claim that ocean waters are the primary control knob. The IPCC report also notes that emissions of CO2 from fossil fuel combustion and industrial processes contributed about 78% of the total GHG emissions increase from 1970 to 2010.\n\n2. Evidence 2:\n- Observation: The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has stated that \"recent climate changes, however, cannot be explained by natural causes alone\" and that human activities have been the dominant cause of warming since the mid-20th century.\n- Reasoning: This evidence supports the notion that human activities are driving climate change, which again contradicts Perry's claim. The EPA's statement is consistent with the scientific consensus on climate change.\n\n### Additional Analysis:\n  The overwhelming consensus among scientists and the evidence provided by reputable organizations like the IPCC and EPA support the conclusion that human activities, particularly CO2 emissions, are a significant factor in climate change.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n- Claim Status: Refuted\n- Language: English\n- Date: 2017\n- Country: US\n- URL: https://science.feedback.org/review/energy-secretary-rick-perry-incorrectly-claims-co2-not-primary-cause-climate-change/, https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar5/wg1/#.T0yLJwUo6Mo",

The review found that most of the studies cited are irrelevant to the topic and do not provide evidence against human-caused global warming.\n\n### Step-by-Step Evaluation:\n\n1. Evidence from Science Feedback Review:\n- Observation: The Science Feedback review found that most of the 58 studies cited in the Breitbart article are irrelevant to the topic of human-caused global warming.\n- Reasoning: This evidence supports the claim that \"Global warming\" is not a myth, as it shows that the majority of the studies do not refute human-caused global warming.\n\n2. Evidence from Snopes Investigation:\n- Observation: An investigation by Snopes found that the report misrepresents the findings of the scientists who conducted the research.\n- Reasoning: This evidence also supports the claim that \"Global warming\" is not a myth, as it shows that the report's claims were based on poor research and misinterpretation of scientific data.\n\n### Additional Analysis:\n\nConsidering multiple pieces of evidence, we can conclude that the claim that 80 graphs from 58 peer-reviewed scientific papers published in 2017 prove that \"global warming\" is a myth is likely false. The Science Feedback review and Snopes investigation both found that most of the studies are irrelevant or misinterpreted, and do not provide evidence against human-caused global warming.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n- Claim Status: Refuted\n- Language: English\n- Date: 2017\n- Country: US\n- URL: https://www.snopes.com/energy/globalwarming/graphs.asp",

Evidence 1: Climate models have successfully predicted the observed warming trend over the past century, and the overwhelming majority of scientific evidence supports the conclusion that human activities are causing the Earth's surface to warm due to greenhouse gas emissions.\n\n- Observation: The climate models have accurately forecasted the temperature increase.\n- Reasoning: This evidence directly contradicts the claim made by Craig Idso. Climate models' success in predicting the warming trend over the past century supports the notion that human activities, not natural variability, are driving global warming.\n\n2. Evidence 2: The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and its Fifth Assessment Report conclude that human activities are the dominant cause of the observed warming since the mid-20th century.\n\n- Observation: The IPCC's conclusion is based on a thorough analysis of scientific evidence.\n- Reasoning: This evidence further reinforces the idea that natural variability cannot explain modern global warming. The IPCC's assessment, which represents the consensus view among climate scientists, contradicts the claim made by Craig Idso.\n\n### Additional Analysis:\n\nThe Science Feedback webpage provides a comprehensive review of Craig Idso's reviewed content on climate-related topics. Each review includes a quote from the original article and an analysis that flags the content as \"Misleading\", \"Incorrect\", or \"Inaccurate\". This suggests that Craig Idso's claim is not supported by the scientific consensus.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n- Claim Status: Refuted\n- Language: English\n- Date: Not specified\n- Country: US\n- URL: https://science.feedback.org/review/natural-variability-can-not-explain-modern-global-warming-heartland-institute-report-claims/",

The first article reviews a claim that the Earth may cool in coming decades due to solar variability, concluding that this claim is incorrect and has no bearing on climate science, model projections, or basic physical theory. The second article discusses the recent UN climate change report, which warns of catastrophic warming if immediate action is not taken to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.\n\n### Step-by-Step Evaluation:\n\n1. Evidence 1:  \n- Observation: According to the first article, solar variability has a small forcing effect on the Earth's heat content relative to human CO2 emissions.\n- Reasoning: This evidence suggests that even if there were a cooling trend due to solar variability, it would be significantly overshadowed by the impact of human CO2 emissions.\n\n2. Evidence 2:  \n- Observation: The same article cites three scientists who reviewed the claim and found no evidence to support the idea that solar variability will cause global cooling.\n- Reasoning: This additional evidence further supports the conclusion that the original claim is incorrect, as multiple experts in the field have thoroughly evaluated the claim and found it lacking.\n\n### Additional Analysis:  \nConsidering both articles, there is a clear consensus among climate scientists that human CO2 emissions are driving climate change, and natural variability from the sun does not have a significant impact on global temperatures.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n- Claim Status: Refuted\n- Language: English\n- Date: N/A (contextual information only)\n- Country: US\n- URL: https://science.feedback.org/review/lull-solar-activity-little-effect-global-temperatures-claims-global-cooling-not-based-science/",

The review cites several experts in the field of climate science, including Ed Hawkins, Principal Research Fellow at the National Centre for Atmospheric Science, Eric Guilyardi, CNRS Research Director at the University of Pierre and Marie Curie, James Renwick, Professor at Victoria University of Wellington, and Daniel Swain, Climate Scientist at the University of California, Los Angeles.\n\n### Step-by-Step Evaluation:\n\n1. Evidence 1:\n- Observation: The review by Science Feedback disputes the claim made by the Heartland Institute that global warming has not ceased.\n- Reasoning: This evidence supports the refutation of the claim that global warming ceased around the end of the twentieth century and was followed (since 1997) by 19 years of stable temperature. The experts cited in the review state that there is no evidence to support this claim, and instead, the current rate of global warming is consistent with predictions made by climate models based on human-caused greenhouse gas emissions.\n\n2. Evidence 2:\n- Observation: Ted Letcher's profile page on Science Feedback lists a review of an article claiming that global warming ceased in 1997.\n- Reasoning: This evidence further supports the refutation of the claim that global warming ceased around the end of the twentieth century and was followed (since 1997) by 19 years of stable temperature. Ted Letcher's review categorizes this article as \"Inaccurate\", indicating that the claim is not supported by scientific data.\n\n### Additional Analysis:\nThe reviews conducted by Science Feedback experts provide a comprehensive evaluation of the claim made by the Heartland Institute. The lack of credible evidence or scientific data to support the claim, combined with the consistent findings from climate models based on human-caused greenhouse gas emissions, further reinforces the refutation of this claim.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n- Claim Status: Refuted\n- Language: English\n- Date: Not specified (but likely to be recent, given the sources cited)\n- Country: None (global warming is a global phenomenon and not specific to one country or region)\n- URL: https://science.feedback.org/review/global-warming-not-ceased-heartland-institute-report-falsely-claims/",

Evidence 1: Review by Science Feedback \n- Observation: The review states that Thomas Frederikse and Benjamin Horton argue that global data contradicts the claim that there is no acceleration in sea level rise.\n- Reasoning: This evidence supports the claim that sea-level rise is accelerating, as it highlights the consistency of multiple lines of evidence from satellite altimetry, tide gauges, and ocean models.\n\n2. Evidence 2: Article on Northern Greenland's ice shelves \n- Observation: The article discusses the rapid melting of Northern Greenland's ice shelves, which contributes to sea level rise.\n- Reasoning: This evidence supports the claim that sea-level rise is accelerating, as it highlights the vulnerability of remaining Greenland ice shelves and the consequences of their decline.\n\n3. Evidence 3: Review of Heartland Institute's claim \n- Observation: The review concludes that the Heartland Institute's claim that global sea levels are not accelerating is INACCURATE.\n- Reasoning: This evidence supports the claim that sea-level rise is accelerating, as it highlights the evidence from experts at the Earth Observatory of Singapore, the University of California, Los Angeles, and Lamont-Doherty Cooperative Sea Level Monitoring Program.\n\n4. Evidence 4: Study on sea-level rise \n- Observation: The study states that sea-level rise is accelerating and its rate could double in the next century.\n- Reasoning: This evidence supports the claim that sea-level rise is accelerating, as it provides a specific prediction of the future rate of acceleration.\n\n5.

Evidence 1:\n- Observation: According to the provided text, scientists and experts confirm that global sea levels have been rising for over 100 years, with an accelerating pace in recent decades.\n- Reasoning: This evidence refutes the claim made by The Heartland Institute, suggesting that local and regional sea levels exhibit typical natural variability. The observation indicates a consistent trend of global sea level rise over time, contradicting the idea of variability.\n\n2. Evidence 2:\n- Observation: Studies have shown that Greenland's ice sheet is melting at an accelerating pace, contributing to sea level rise.\n- Reasoning: This evidence further supports the notion that global sea levels are rising and not exhibiting typical natural variability. The study on Greenland's ice sheet melting reinforces the idea of an accelerating rate of sea level rise.\n\n3. Experts' Consensus:\n- Observation: Reviewers from various scientific institutions and organizations, including the Earth Observatory of Singapore, the University of California, Los Angeles, and Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory, Columbia University, confirm that global sea levels are indeed rising and accelerating due to human-caused climate change.\n- Reasoning: This evidence provides additional support for the claim that global sea levels are rising, contradicting the idea of variability.\n\n### Additional Analysis:\nThe provided text also mentions a review of Craig Idso's content by Science Feedback, which found many claims to be Misleading, Incorrect, Inaccurate, Flawed Reasoning, or Incorrect.

Evidence 1: The article about Greenland's ice sheet\n    - Observation: According to a new study, most of the change in Greenland's ice sheet can happen by 2100, with approximately 3.3% of the ice sheet projected to melt, equivalent to about 2.5 feet of sea-level rise.\n    - Reasoning: This evidence supports the claim that the warming is not nearly as great as the climate change computer models have predicted. The study suggests that a significant portion of Greenland's ice sheet could melt by 2100, which is a relatively short timeframe compared to the predictions made by climate models.\n\n2. Evidence 2: The article about Antarctica's ice sheets\n    - Observation: Researchers have discovered that medieval ocean creatures can help predict whether the AMOC system (which transports heat from the equator to higher latitudes) is about to collapse or not.\n    - Reasoning: This evidence does not directly support or refute the claim. However, it highlights the complexity and unpredictability of climate change phenomena, which could be interpreted as indicating that computer models may not always accurately predict the impacts of warming.\n\n3. Evidence 3: The article about billion-dollar disasters\n    - Observation: Billion-dollar disasters in the United States can be used to communicate the impacts of climate change on the economy.\n    - Reasoning: This evidence does not directly support or refute the claim. However, it emphasizes the importance of considering societal factors when discussing climate change and its impacts.\n\n### Additional Analysis:\n\n- Integrating multiple pieces of evidence, we see that while there are some discrepancies between predicted and actual climate change outcomes, the overall trend suggests that warming is indeed occurring and having significant impacts on global climate patterns and regional weather events. However, it is also important to recognize the complexity and unpredictability of these phenomena.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n- Claim Status: Not Enough Information\n- Language: English\n- Date: 2024-12-24\n- Country: US\n- URL: https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2024/12/24/amoc-collapse-system-climate/",

Evidence 1:\n- Observation: Zeke Hausfather's statement that 2016 would still be the hottest year on record without El Niño.\n- Reasoning: This evidence supports the claim that the rise in global temperatures may not be solely due to man-made emissions, as it suggests that natural variability (in this case, El Niño) can also contribute to temperature records. However, this statement alone does not provide conclusive evidence for or against human-caused climate change.\n\n2. Evidence 2:\n- Observation: The article mentions that the Daily Mail article claiming that El Niño drove record highs in global temperatures is rated -1.8 (very low) because it is misleading and cherry-picks data.\n- Reasoning: This evidence refutes the claim that El Niño drives record highs in global temperatures, as the rating indicates a lack of credibility for this particular article. However, it does not directly address the claim being evaluated.\n\n### Additional Analysis:\nThe summary suggests that many climate-related articles are inaccurate or misleading, which highlights the importance of critically evaluating sources and information. Additionally, Zeke Hausfather's statement implies that natural variability can contribute to temperature records, but it does not provide conclusive evidence for or against human-caused climate change.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n- Claim Status: Not Enough Information\n- Language: English\n- Date: N/A\n- Country: US (assuming the context is in English and from a US-based source)\n- URL: https://science.feedback.org/member/zeke-hausfather/\n\nNote: The evaluation is based on the provided text, which does not contain conclusive evidence to support or refute the claim.

Evidence 1:\n- Observation: The article \"Review of the claim that sea-level rise is not accelerating and is therefore not a significant risk for coastal cities\" states that the reviewers agree that sea-level rise is indeed accelerating.\n- Reasoning: This evidence supports the claim that sea level rise has accelerated, as it contradicts the claim that sea level rise has not accelerated.\n\n2. Evidence 2:\n- Observation: The article \"IPCC Report 15\" states that climate change is largely driven by human activity and that global warming is real.\n- Reasoning: This evidence supports the claim that sea level rise has accelerated, as it suggests that human activities are contributing to climate change, which in turn affects sea levels.\n\n3. Evidence 3:\n- Observation: The article \"Kamala Harris vs Donald Trump on Climate Change\" shows significant differences in their views on climate change, with Kamala Harris emphasizing the need for urgent action and Donald Trump downplaying its impact.\n- Reasoning: This evidence supports the claim that sea level rise has accelerated, as it highlights the urgency of addressing climate change.\n\n### Additional Analysis:\nConsidering the cumulative effect of these pieces of evidence, it is clear that the claim \"Sea level rise, which was occurring long before humans could be blamed, has not accelerated\" is refuted by the available data.

The data from these sources demonstrates a consistent pattern of temperature increases, which cannot be solely attributed to natural fluctuations.\n\n2. Evidence 2: Shrinking ice sheets and glaciers, sea-level rise, and shifts in species migration patterns and distribution.\n- Observation: Studies have observed shrinking ice sheets and glaciers, rising sea levels, and changes in species migration patterns and distribution.\n- Reasoning: This evidence also supports the claim that human-induced climate change is occurring. The observed changes in these natural systems are consistent with the expected effects of global warming.\n\n3. Evidence 3: Scientific consensus on climate change among 97% of climate scientists.\n- Observation: A survey conducted by Doran and Zimmermann (2009) found that 97% of climate scientists agree that human-induced climate change is occurring.\n- Reasoning: This evidence refutes the claim that there is no scientific evidence to support the idea of human-induced climate change.

Evidence 1:  \n- Observation: The context states that during the Archean Eon (around 3.8-2.5 billion years ago), Earth was much colder than it is today, with temperatures as low as -50°C (-58°F). This was despite having higher levels of CO2 in the atmosphere than we have now.\n- Reasoning: This evidence suggests that high levels of CO2 do not necessarily lead to a cold climate. Additionally, the context notes that human-caused global warming is attributed to an increase in temperature since the late 1800s.\n\n2. Evidence 2:  \n- Observation: The study mentioned in the Washington Post article (URL: https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2024/09/19/earth-temperature-global-warming-planet/) found that Earth's temperature has warmed by 1.2°C since the late 1800s.\n- Reasoning: This evidence supports the claim that human-caused global warming is real and suggests a significant increase in temperature over time.\n\nAdditional Analysis:  \nConsidering these two pieces of evidence, it seems unlikely that halving today's atmospheric CO2 content would lead to the death of all life.

Evidence 2: Review of multiple studies\n- Observation: The review notes that the author of the original article ignored evidence from multiple studies that show ocean acidification can have negative impacts on marine life.\n- Reasoning: This evidence provides additional support for the claim being inaccurate, as it highlights the existence of contrary research that was not considered in the original article.\n\n### Additional Analysis:\n\nConsidering both pieces of evidence and the context provided by Science Feedback's methodology, community standards, and contact details, it appears that the original article's conclusion is likely inaccurate. The review's findings suggest that the author cherry-picked data to support their claim, which is inconsistent with the scientific consensus.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n- Claim Status: Refuted\n- Language: English\n- Date: Not specified\n- Country: US\n- URL: https://science.feedback.org/review/ocean-acidification-expected-harm-marine-ecosystems-overall-cherry-picking-can-lead-opposite-conclusion/",

        "result": "### Analysis of Claim:\n\n- Key Information from Context:  \nThe context provides three articles discussing climate change and human-caused carbon emissions. The claim is that there is no evidence that human-produced carbon is a significant factor in climate change.\n\n### Step-by-Step Evaluation:\n\n1. Evidence 1:\n- Observation: According to an article by Science Feedback, the overwhelming consensus among experts is that climate change is real and primarily caused by human activities, such as burning fossil fuels and deforestation.\n- Reasoning: This evidence supports the claim that human-produced carbon is a significant factor in climate change. The consensus among experts confirms the link between human activities and climate change.\n\n2. Evidence 2:\n- Observation: An article from USA Today states that humans emitted over 1 trillion metric tons of CO2 through fossil fuel emissions and land use changes, leading to a significant increase in atmospheric CO2 concentrations.\n- Reasoning: This evidence also supports the claim that human-produced carbon is a significant factor in climate change. The data on CO2 emissions and atmospheric concentration levels indicates a clear link between human activities and climate change.\n\n3. Evidence 3:\n- Observation: An article from Washington Post discusses the potential collapse of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) system, which is influenced by global climate patterns.\n- Reasoning: This evidence supports the claim that human-produced carbon is a significant factor in climate change. The discussion on AMOC's potential collapse highlights the importance of understanding human-induced climate change.\n\n4. Evidence 4:\n- Observation: An article from Deutsche Welle emphasizes Germany's moral responsibility to reduce its emissions due to its historical role in industrialization and current high standards of living.\n- Reasoning: This evidence supports the claim that human-produced carbon is a significant factor in climate change. The emphasis on reducing emissions highlights the importance of addressing human-induced climate change.\n\nAdditional Analysis:\nThe cumulative effect of human-emitted CO2 has a significant impact on the planet, as seen in the data and discussions provided. Despite Germany being a relatively small emitter compared to other countries, its efforts to reduce emissions are crucial for global climate goals.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n- Claim Status: Refuted\n- Language: English\n- Date: YYYY-MM-DD (not specified)\n- Country: US/CA (relevant countries for the articles)\n- URL: [https://www.sciencefeedback.com/, https://www.usatoday.com/, https://www.washingtonpost.com/, https://www.dw.com/en/]",

The review concludes that this claim is unsupported by scientific evidence.\n\n### Step-by-Step Evaluation:\n\n1. Evidence 1: Climate models do not include cosmic ray effects as a major contributor to global warming.\n- Observation: Climate models do not account for the impact of cosmic rays on global warming.\n- Reasoning: This observation supports the conclusion that cosmic rays are not a crucial player in current climate change, as their effects are not considered significant in climate models.\n\n2. Evidence 2: The observed temperature increase since the 1950s cannot be explained by changes in cosmic rays, but can be attributed to increasing greenhouse gas emissions and other human activities.\n- Observation: The temperature increase since the 1950s is primarily driven by human activities and not by changes in cosmic rays.\n- Reasoning: This observation also supports the conclusion that cosmic rays are not a crucial player in current climate change, as their impact on global warming is negligible compared to human-driven factors.\n\n### Additional Analysis:\nThe review's conclusion that the claim is unsupported by evidence is further supported by the lack of consideration for cosmic ray effects in climate models and the inability to explain the observed temperature increase solely through changes in cosmic rays. The scientific consensus suggests that human activities are the primary driver of global warming, and cosmic rays do not play a significant role.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n- Claim Status: Refuted\n- Language: English\n- Date: Not specified\n- Country: US\n- URL: https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/interactive/2023/american-agriculture-farming-climate-change/",

Evidence 1: Scientific Consensus on Human-Induced Climate Change\n- Observation: According to the article, more than 97% of climate scientists agree that global warming is caused by human activities.\n- Reasoning: This evidence supports the claim that human-induced climate change is real and not a natural cycle. The scientific consensus on this topic has been widely established through peer-reviewed research.\n\n2. Evidence 2: IPCC Conclusion on Human Influence\n- Observation: The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has concluded that the balance of evidence suggests a discernible human influence on global climate.\n- Reasoning: This evidence also supports the claim, as it comes from a reputable and authoritative source, the IPCC. The conclusion is based on the collective analysis of scientific research.\n\n3. Evidence 3: Analysis of Peer-Reviewed Research\n- Observation: A study analyzing 11,944 abstracts published in peer-reviewed scientific literature between 1991 and 2011 found that less than 1% of the papers rejected the idea of human influence on climate change.\n- Reasoning: This evidence further supports the claim by demonstrating a significant consensus among scientists. The study's findings are based on a large sample size, making it more reliable.\n\n### Additional Analysis:\n\nConsidering multiple pieces of evidence and contextual factors, we can conclude that the scientific consensus on human-induced climate change is overwhelming.

        "result": "### Analysis of Claim:\n\n- Key Information from Context:\nThe provided context does not directly address the claim \"Sea-level rise does not seem to depend on ocean temperature, and certainly not on CO2.\" However, it mentions a review that disputes Fred Singer's claim that sea-level rise is not caused by climate change. The review argues that there is a clear relationship between the accelerating rate of sea-level rise and the increasing global temperature.\n\n### Step-by-Step Evaluation:\n\n1. Evidence from Science Feedback Review:\n- Observation: The review disputing Fred Singer's claim states that there is a clear relationship between the accelerating rate of sea-level rise and the increasing global temperature.\n- Reasoning: This evidence supports the claim that human-caused climate change is a major driver of sea-level rise, which suggests that ocean temperature (a component of global temperature) and CO2 levels are related to sea-level rise.\n\n2. Evidence from Chris Roberts' Research:\n- Observation: Chris Roberts, a research scientist at ECMWF/Met Office, has conducted research on the topic.\n- Reasoning: Although specific details about his research are not provided, his involvement in the review suggests that he may have contributed to the understanding of sea-level rise and its relationship to climate change.\n\n3. Evidence from Stefan Rahmstorf's Research:\n- Observation: Stefan Rahmstorf, a professor at Potsdam University, has conducted research on the topic.\n- Reasoning: Similar to Chris Roberts' involvement, Rahmstorf's research may have contributed to the understanding of sea-level rise and its relationship to climate change.\n\n### Additional Analysis:\n\nConsidering the evidence from the review, Chris Roberts', and Stefan Rahmstorf's research, it is reasonable to conclude that human-caused climate change, which includes rising ocean temperatures and increasing CO2 levels, is a major driver of sea-level rise. This conclusion is supported by multiple sources and experts in the field.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n- Claim Status: Supported\n- Language: English\n- Date: 2023-03-20 (approximate)\n- Country: US\n- URL: https://science.feedback.org/review/fred-singer-incorrectly-claims-sea-level-rise-is-not-caused-by-climate-change",

        "result": "### Analysis of Claim:\n\n- Key Information from Context:\nThe provided context suggests that Tony Abbott, a former Prime Minister of Australia, claimed that Australia has only warmed by 0.3 degrees over the past century, which is significantly lower than the official data from the Bureau of Meteorology showing a warming of 0.9-1 degree since 1910.\n\n### Step-by-Step Evaluation:\n\n1. Evidence 1:\n- Observation: The review notes that Tony Abbott's claim is inconsistent with scientific evidence and is incorrect.\n- Reasoning: This evidence suggests that the official records show a clear trend of warming in Australia over the past century, which contradicts Abbott's claim. Additionally, expert opinions from scientists at the University of New South Wales and Maynooth University indicate that natural climate variability from the sun and volcanic eruptions does not account for recent climate change.\n\n2. Evidence 2:\n- Observation: The Science Feedback review concludes that Tony Abbott's claim is incorrect and inconsistent with scientific evidence.\n- Reasoning: This evidence further supports the finding that Abbott's claim is inaccurate, as it is based on expert opinions from reputable institutions and organizations. Additionally, the review highlights specific inaccuracies or biases in the articles it evaluates.\n\nAdditional Analysis:\nThe fact-checking reviews conducted by Professor Thorne at Maynooth University and Markus Donat at the University of New South Wales provide additional evidence supporting the conclusion that Tony Abbott's claim is incorrect. These experts have analyzed temperature datasets and climatology, providing a high level of credibility to their opinions.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n- Claim Status: Refuted\n- Language: English\n- Date: Not specified (but implied to be sometime in 2017 or later)\n- Country: AU\n- URL: https://science.feedback.org/review/former-prime-minister-tony-abbott-wrongly-claims-australia-warmed-far-less-data-show/",

Evidence 1:\n- Observation: The article reviewed by Science Feedback suggests that climate scientists say that human-induced global warming has increased the likelihood and severity of extreme weather events like Hurricane Harvey.\n- Reasoning: This evidence supports the claim, as it suggests that climate change may have played a role in increasing the rainfall and severity of Hurricane Harvey.\n\n2. Evidence 2:\n- Observation: The review highlights that while climate change may not have directly caused the storm, it can make heavy rainfall more extreme and increase the likelihood of such events occurring.\n- Reasoning: This evidence further supports the claim, as it emphasizes the potential role of climate change in enhancing heavy rainfall and increasing the likelihood of extreme weather events.\n\n3. Evidence 3:\n- Observation: The reviewers note that attributing a specific weather event to climate change is challenging and requires careful consideration of multiple factors.\n- Reasoning: This evidence does not directly support or refute the claim, but rather highlights the complexity of attributing weather events to climate change.\n\n### Additional Analysis:\n\n- Integrating the evidence from the Science Feedback reviews, it appears that while Hurricane Harvey was a complex event influenced by various factors, climate change may have played some role in increasing its severity and rainfall.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n- Claim Status: Supported\n- Language: English\n- Date: 2017\n- Country: US\n- URL: https://science.feedback.org/review/climate-context-tropical-storm-harvey-robinson-meyer/",

Evidence 1: NASA's GISS Surface Temperature Analysis\n- Observation: The analysis shows a continued long-term warming trend since the 1970s.\n- Reasoning: This evidence supports the claim that global temperatures have not declined over the last decade, as it suggests a steady increase in temperature over time.\n\n2. Evidence 2: Review of Lord Lawson's Claim by Scientists\n- Observation: The majority of scientists reviewed various data sources, including NASA's GISS Surface Temperature Analysis, and concluded that Lord Lawson's claim is false.\n- Reasoning: This evidence refutes the claim, as it provides a consensus among experts that global temperatures have not declined over the past decade.\n\n3. Evidence 3: Study on Earth's Temperature Changes\n- Observation: The study found that even under worst-case scenarios, human-caused warming will not push the Earth beyond habitability.\n- Reasoning: This evidence supports the claim that mean global temperature has slightly declined, as it suggests that the Earth's temperature changes are unprecedented and could create conditions unlike anything seen in the past 300,000 years.\n\nAdditional Analysis:\nConsidering multiple pieces of evidence, it is clear that Lord Lawson's claim that global temperatures have declined over the last decade is refuted by a consensus among experts.

Evidence 1:\n- Observation: Global temperatures have continued to rise over the past decade.\n- Reasoning: This piece of evidence contradicts the claim that global warming has ceased, as it shows a continuous increase in temperature over the past decade. The observation is supported by numerous studies and observations.\n\n2. Evidence 2:\n- Observation: The past 10 years have been the warmest on record since 1880.\n- Reasoning: This evidence further supports the claim that global warming has not ceased, as it shows a consistent trend of increasing temperatures over time.\n\n3. Evidence 3:\n- Observation: Arctic sea ice has been declining at a rate of around 13% per decade.\n- Reasoning: The decline in Arctic sea ice is another indication that global warming is ongoing and has not ceased. This evidence is relevant to the claim, as it shows a negative trend in one aspect of climate change.\n\n4. Evidence 4:\n- Observation: Glaciers are melting and sea levels are rising.\n- Reasoning: These observations are consistent with the expectation of ongoing global warming, which would lead to glacier melting and sea level rise.\n\n### Additional Analysis:\n\nThe review also notes that the Heartland Institute's report does not account for natural climate variability or the impact of human activities on climate change.

Evidence 1:\n- Observation: The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's fifth assessment report states it's \"extremely likely\" (at least 95 percent probable) that human activity is the dominant cause of global warming since the mid-20th century.\n- Reasoning: This evidence supports the claim that carbon dioxide emissions from human activities are significantly contributing to global warming. The IPCC is a reputable scientific organization, and their assessment report is considered authoritative in the field of climate science.\n\n2. Evidence 2:\n- Observation: Climate scientists have found it \"extremely likely\" that human activities, including CO2 emissions, are the main cause of warming since the mid-20th century.\n- Reasoning: This evidence also supports the claim that carbon dioxide emissions from human activities are significantly contributing to global warming. The use of the phrase \"extremely likely\" suggests a high level of confidence in the scientific consensus.\n\n3. Evidence 3:\n- Observation: Environmental Protection Agency head Scott Pruitt said he does not agree that CO2 is a primary contributor to global warming, but scientific evidence and data show that CO2 emissions from human activities are significantly contributing to global warming.\n- Reasoning: This evidence refutes the claim that carbon dioxide emissions are not a significant contributor to global warming.

Evidence 2:\n- Observation: Christopher Merchant notes that while the margin between 2016 and 2015 is small, previous years were significantly cooler, illustrating a trend towards warmer temperatures.\n- Reasoning: This evidence also supports the claim that 2016 was a global temperature record. Merchant's point about previous years being cooler suggests a long-term warming trend.\n\n3. Evidence 3:\n- Observation: Science Feedback reviews the WSJ editorial and finds it lacking in context and cherry-picking data, ultimately supporting the scientific consensus on 2016 as a record-breaking year.\n- Reasoning: This evidence further supports the claim that 2016 was indeed a global temperature record. Science Feedback's review highlights the lack of contextual information in the WSJ editorial, which may have led to an inaccurate conclusion.\n\n### Additional Analysis:\nThe context mentions various records set in 2024, including extremely high temperatures globally. While this does not directly address the claim about 2016, it provides additional context for understanding global temperature trends.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n- Claim Status: Supported\n- Language: English\n- Date: YYYY-MM-DD (no specific date provided)\n- Country: US (Wall Street Journal is based in the United States)\n- URL:\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2024/02/08/1-5-celsius-global-warming-record/\nhttps://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2024/03/23/heat-records-broken-in-2024-list/72953026007/\nNote: The URLs provided are from the context, not specifically related to the claim being evaluated.",

Evidence 1: \n- Observation: The article \"A viral photo collage on social media claims to show that sea levels have remained stable for 140 years at Rio de Janeiro's Sugarloaf Mountain.\"\n- Reasoning: This evidence suggests that the claim is false, as fact-checking reveals that sea level rise is not a uniform phenomenon and that land reclamation on the Urca peninsula has resulted in buildings being constructed at the foot of Sugarloaf Mountain, which can be misinterpreted as evidence of no sea level rise.\n\n2. Evidence 2: \n- Observation: The article \"Jill Stein, the Green Party presidential candidate in 2016, made a claim that global warming would cause sea levels to rise on average 'not one yard but many yards' in as soon as 50 years.\"\n- Reasoning: This evidence suggests that Stein's claim is greatly exaggerated and not supported by current scientific consensus. The predicted maximum global mean sea level rise by 2100 is around 1.33 yards (4.07 meters) above current levels.\n\nAdditional Analysis:\nThe experts' warnings about rising sea levels posing a \"severe adaptation challenge\" and the need for institutions like the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) to provide accurate information highlight the importance of considering scientific consensus in evaluating claims related to climate change.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n- Claim Status: Refuted\n- Language: English\n- Date: 2016\n- Country: US\n- URL: https://www.factcheck.org/2022/11/factchecking-trumps-presidential-bid-announcement/, https://science.feedback.org/review/climate-exaggeration-backfiring-robert-bradley-jr-forbes/, https://www.factcheck.org/2022/02/trump-climate-change-comments-misleading",

        "result": "### Analysis of Claim:\n\n- Key Information from Context: The context provides information on the Medieval Warm Period and its comparison to the current climate warming trend.\n\n### Step-by-Step Evaluation:\n\n1. Evidence 1:\n- Observation: The first piece of evidence comes from Verificat, a fact-checking platform in Catalonia, which states that while temperatures rose by 1-2°C above early 20th-century levels during the medieval warm period at European locations, the current climate crisis has seen a much more rapid and unprecedented rise in temperatures of around 2°C since the mid-19th century.\n- Reasoning: This evidence supports the claim that the current climate warming trend is different from the Medieval Warm Period. The fact that temperatures rose rapidly and globally during the current period, unlike the regional fluctuations observed during the medieval warm period, suggests that human activities are driving the current climate change.\n\n2. Evidence 2:\n- Observation: A review by Science Feedback states that there is no global temperature record for the Medieval period, local temperatures may have been warmer or cooler during this time, but there is no evidence of a globally warmer climate.\n- Reasoning: This evidence refutes the claim that the Medieval Warm Period was warmer than the current climate warming trend. The absence of a global temperature record for the Medieval period means that direct comparisons between the two periods are not possible, and local temperature variations do not necessarily indicate a globally warmer climate.\n\n3. Evidence 3:\n- Observation: A fact-check article by USA Today states that NASA and other climate agencies report that the planet has actually warmed by around 1.36 degrees Celsius (2.45 degrees Fahrenheit) compared to average temperatures between 1850 and 1900, making it warmer than during medieval times on a global level.\n- Reasoning: This evidence supports the claim that the current climate warming trend is different from the Medieval Warm Period. The observed temperature increase since 1850 contradicts the idea that the Medieval Warm Period was globally warmer.\n\n### Additional Analysis:\n\nConsidering multiple pieces of evidence and contextual factors, it is clear that the current climate warming trend is distinct from the Medieval Warm Period. While local temperatures may have been warmer during certain times in history, there is no conclusive evidence to suggest a globally warmer climate during the Medieval period. The observed temperature increase since 1850, as well as the rapid and global nature of the current climate change, further supports this conclusion.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n- Claim Status: Refuted\n- Language: English\n- Date: Ongoing\n- Country: CA (Catalonia)\n- URL: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/factcheck/2024/07/30/earth-warmer-than-medieval-times-fact-check/74552916007/, https://science.feedback.org/review/the-earth-was-not-warmer-in-medieval-times-town-hall-gregory-rummo/, https://verificat.cat/en/claim/The-Earth-has-cooled-4-degrees-since-medieval-times-and-warmed-only-0.7-degrees-since-1850",

Evidence 3:\n- Observation: The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) also started using the term \"climate change\" in its reports, citing the need for a more comprehensive understanding of the issue.\n- Reasoning: This evidence supports the claim that there was a shift towards using the term \"climate change\", but does not specifically address the reason for this shift.\n\n### Additional Analysis:\n\n- The context suggests that the change from \"global warming\" to \"climate change\" was driven by a desire to acknowledge the complexity of climate-related issues and to highlight the need for a more comprehensive approach. This is supported by the evidence provided, which suggests that the change was not driven by a single event or occurrence.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n- Claim Status: Supported\n- Language: English\n- Date: 2005 (approximate)\n- Country: US\n- URL: [https://www.nap.edu/read/11173/chapter/1](https://www.nap.edu/read/11173/chapter/1)",

        "result": "### Analysis of Claim:\n\n- Key Information from Context:\nThe context provides information about Antarctic sea ice and its relationship with climate change. The articles discuss the increase in Antarctic sea ice extent, changes in atmospheric pressure and wind patterns, and the potential impact on global climate patterns.\n\n### Step-by-Step Evaluation:\n\n1. Evidence 1: \n- Observation: According to the article from Washington Post (2014), Antarctic sea ice extent has been increasing over the same period when Arctic sea ice is declining.\n- Reasoning: This evidence supports the claim that Southern sea ice is increasing, but it's important to note that this trend is small and may not be a significant indicator of climate change.\n\n2. Evidence 2:\n- Observation: The article from Washington Post (2016) discusses changes in sea ice transport and its potential impact on global climate patterns.\n- Reasoning: This evidence suggests that sea ice can play a larger role than previously thought in driving changes in the climate system, but it does not provide conclusive proof of an increase in Antarctic sea ice extent.\n\n3. Evidence 3:\n- Observation: According to the article from Washington Post (2017), Antarctic sea ice levels reached a record low for late June.\n- Reasoning: This evidence refutes the claim that Southern sea ice is increasing, as it shows a decline in sea ice extent instead.\n\n4. Evidence 4:\n- Observation: The review from Feedback.org debunks claims that Antarctic sea ice is increasing or the continent is getting colder.\n- Reasoning: This evidence supports the refutation of the claim, as it cites scientific data and research showing that the Antarctic ice sheet is losing mass at a rate of about 150 billion tons per year.\n\n5. Evidence 5:\n- Observation: The article from AAP FactCheck debunks claims that the Antarctic ice sheet is gaining mass or North Pole's sea ice cover has increased in recent years.\n- Reasoning: This evidence supports the refutation of the claim, as it cites credible sources and expert opinions showing that the Antarctic ice sheet is losing mass and Arctic sea ice is declining.\n\n### Additional Analysis:\nConsidering multiple pieces of evidence, it appears that the trend in Antarctic sea ice extent is more complex than initially suggested. While some articles suggest an increase, others show a decline or no significant change. The majority of evidence suggests that the Antarctic ice sheet is losing mass, which contradicts the initial claim.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n- Claim Status: Refuted\n- Language: English\n- Date: 2014-2020 (approximate range of article publication dates)\n- Country: US/CA/AU (sources from Washington Post and AAP FactCheck are based in these countries)\n- URL:\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/article/antartic-sea-ice-is-still-in-decline-despite-some-recent-gains/amp\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp/2016/12/14/new-data-shows-the-arctic-ice-cap-is-still-in-decline/\nhttps://www.aap.org/factcheck/cold-hard-nonsense-floated-about-polar-ice/\nhttps://feedback.org/review/antarctic-ice-coverage-not-increasing-record-levels-nor-continent-getting-colder-contrary-to-curry-easterbrook-cfact-movie/",

One claim is that solar cycles cause global warming, which we will evaluate.\n\n### Step-by-Step Evaluation:\n\n1. Evidence 1: \n- Observation: The text from Science Feedback, a non-profit organization dedicated to science education and reviewing claims made about scientific topics, concludes that Ben Davidson's claim that the current climate change is caused by the Sun is inaccurate.\n- Reasoning: This evidence refutes the claim that solar cycles cause global warming. According to the review, human activities, such as burning fossil fuels and deforestation, are the main drivers of global warming, not changes in solar radiation.\n\n2. Evidence 2: \n- Observation: The article from Science Feedback reviews a claim made by Ben Davidson on his YouTube channel Suspicious Observers that the current climate change is caused by the Sun.\n- Reasoning: This evidence also refutes the claim that solar cycles cause global warming, as it concludes that human activities are the primary cause of global warming, not changes in solar radiation.\n\n3. Evidence 3: \n- Observation: The review from Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK) and NASA/University of Maryland concludes that Ben Davidson's claim is inconsistent with the science.\n- Reasoning: This evidence further refutes the claim that solar cycles cause global warming, as it argues that human activities are the main drivers of global warming, not changes in solar radiation.\n\n### Additional Analysis:\n\nConsidering multiple pieces of evidence and contextual factors, we can conclude that there is no credible scientific evidence to support the claim that solar cycles cause global warming.

Evidence 1: \n- Observation: The article states that the Arctic is warming at a rate twice as fast as the rest of the world, with significant consequences.\n- Reasoning: This evidence suggests that the Arctic has experienced more rapid warming in recent years, which could indicate lower sea ice extent in the past.\n\n2. Evidence 2:\n- Observation: The same article mentions that the Arctic has not yet reached the \"point of no return,\" but it is critical that emissions are reduced quickly to stabilize the sea ice.\n- Reasoning: This evidence implies that there may have been periods in the past where Arctic sea ice extent was higher, as the article highlights the importance of reducing emissions to prevent future declines.\n\n3. Evidence 3:\n- Observation: The article on Antarctica's record-low sea ice coverage notes that this decline is concerning as it may indicate a long-term trend of Antarctic sea ice decline due to climate change.\n- Reasoning: While this evidence does not directly address Arctic sea ice, it suggests that changes in global temperatures could have implications for both polar regions. This might imply that the past had higher sea ice extent in the Arctic.\n\n4. Evidence 4:\n- Observation: The article on the National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC) reports that the Arctic sea ice reached its annual low, measuring 1.44 million square miles.\n- Reasoning: This evidence provides a specific measurement of current Arctic sea ice extent, which does not directly support or refute the claim about past lower sea ice extent.\n\n5. Evidence 5:\n- Observation: The same article mentions that the year 2020 was particularly notable due to unusual warmth at the top of the world.\n- Reasoning: This evidence suggests that recent years have seen anomalous warming in the Arctic, which could indicate higher sea ice extent in the past.\n\n### Additional Analysis:\n\nConsidering multiple pieces of evidence and contextual factors, it appears that the context provides more information about current Arctic sea ice trends rather than its historical extent.

It discusses how rain turns into destructive floods, explains the role of rare weather systems like \"Vb\" systems, and highlights Germany's recent catastrophic flooding as an example of the devastating effects of such events.\n\n### Step-by-Step Evaluation:\n\n1. Evidence 1: \nAccording to the IPCC report, the frequency and severity of extreme weather events such as flooding are expected to increase due to rising global temperatures (Source: [https://www.washingtonpost.com/story/news/weather/2023/01/12/climate-change-atmospheric-rivers-rain/](https://www.washingtonpost.com/story/news/weather/2023/01/12/climate-change-atmospheric-rivers-rain/)).\n\n- Observation: The IPCC report indicates that extreme weather events will become more frequent and severe due to global warming.\n- Reasoning: This evidence supports the claim that extreme weather events are being made more frequent and worse by global warming. The IPCC is a respected scientific organization, and their reports are based on rigorous research and analysis.\n\n2. Evidence 2:\nThe context also mentions that atmospheric rivers will become more frequent and intense due to climate change, leading to increased flooding and mudslides in California (Source: [https://www.washingtonpost.com/story/news/weather/2023/01/12/climate-change-atmospheric-rivers-rain/](https://www.washingtonpost.com/story/news/weather/2023/01/12/climate-change-atmospheric-rivers-rain/)).\n\n- Observation: Atmospheric rivers will become more frequent and intense due to climate change, leading to increased flooding and mudslides.\n- Reasoning: This evidence also supports the claim that extreme weather events are being made more frequent and worse by global warming.

Evidence 1: \n- Observation: According to Snopes, the quote attributed to Rep. Joe Barton (R-TX) is not an accurate representation of his statement during a hearing on renewable energy in 2009.\n- Reasoning: The evidence suggests that the claim is likely false because it misrepresents Barton's actual remarks. [1]\n\n2. Evidence 2:\n- Observation: During the hearing, Barton quoted Dr. David Keith, who stated that wind farms may change the mixing of air near the surface, drying the soil near the site, and that if wind supplied 10% of global electricity demand in 2100, it could cause some regions to experience a temperature change of about 1°C (or 1-1/2°F).\n- Reasoning: This evidence suggests that Barton was discussing potential environmental consequences of large-scale wind energy production, but not claiming that \"wind is a finite resource\" and that harnessing it would cause temperatures to rise.

The PSA aims to raise awareness about climate change and biodiversity, but experts in linguistics and primate research are skeptical of the video's authenticity.\n\n### Step-by-Step Evaluation:\n\n1. Evidence 1: Sherman Wilcox's quote\n- Observation: Sherman Wilcox, a professor of linguistics, claims that the video is \"obviously a doctored video composed of highly edited clips of single signs pieced together to make it look like Koko is actually saying something, when she's not.\"\n- Reasoning: This evidence suggests that the PSA may be heavily edited and manipulated to create the illusion of Koko expressing complex thoughts about climate change. Wilcox's expertise in linguistics supports his assessment.\n\n2. Evidence 2: Herbert Terrace's quote\n- Observation: Herbert Terrace, director of Columbia University's Primate Cognition Lab, states that \"we don't know what Koko's trainer was signing to her before she uttered the various signs... attributed to her.\"\n- Reasoning: This evidence implies that the video may not accurately represent Koko's understanding of climate change or biodiversity. The uncertainty surrounding what Koko's trainer signed to her before she produced the relevant signs further undermines the PSA's authenticity.\n\n### Additional Analysis:\n\nThe article concludes that while Koko is an impressive animal with a remarkable ability to communicate with humans, the PSA is misleading and does not accurately represent her understanding of climate change or biodiversity. The controversy surrounding the video has led some experts to question the credibility of those who study animal intelligence.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n- Claim Status: Refuted\n- Language: English\n- Date: Not specified\n- Country: US\n- URL: https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/what-does-koko-know-about-climate-change-nothing/\n\nThe evidence presented in the context suggests that the PSA featuring Koko is heavily edited and manipulated, and experts are skeptical of its authenticity.

Evidence 1: \n- Observation: The article notes that the claim about Arctic sea ice is based on a single measurement taken on September 17, 2017, which shows an increase in sea ice extent compared to 2012.\n- Reasoning: This evidence supports the claim that there was more sea ice in the Arctic in 2017. However, the article also notes that this increase does not disrupt the overall trend of decreasing Arctic sea ice extent over the past few decades.\n\n2. Evidence 2: \n- Observation: The article points out that the claim about Greenland's ice loss is also based on a single measurement.\n- Reasoning: This evidence supports the claim that there was less melting of glacial ice in Greenland in 2017. However, the article notes that when placed in the context of the entire trend of Greenland's ice mass over time, it does nothing to change the larger and unambiguous trends of overall melting.\n\n### Additional Analysis:\nThe article concludes that neither of these claims provides evidence to doubt the reality of climate change. It notes that climatological science does not require (nor does it expect) temperature or sea ice records to be broken every single year, and that the growth in Arctic sea ice extent is not a new phenomenon.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n- Claim Status: Refuted\n- Language: English\n- Date: 2017\n- Country: US\n- URL: https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/does-arctic-ice-doubt-reality-climate-change/\n\nNote: The claim states that measurements indicating more sea ice in the Arctic and less melting of glacial ice in Greenland in 2017 casts scientific doubt on the reality of global warming.

The claim being evaluated is \"Melting of Arctic sea ice and polar icecaps is not occurring at unnatural rates and does not constitute evidence of a human impact on the climate.\"\n\n### Step-by-Step Evaluation:\n\n1. Evidence 1: Review of Heartland Institute Report\n- Observation: According to a review by Climate Feedback, the Heartland Institute report incorrectly claims that there is no evidence of human impacts in melting ice.\n- Reasoning: The review highlights the importance of accuracy and transparency in climate-related reporting, emphasizing the need for fact-based information to inform public debate and decision-making.\n\n2. Evidence 2: Review of Craig Idso's Work\n- Observation: A review of claims made by Craig Idso, a scientist whose work has been scrutinized by Science Feedback, includes criticisms of his reports on global warming. One of these criticisms is that the Heartland Institute incorrectly claims there is no evidence of human impacts in melting ice.\n- Reasoning: The reviews conducted by Science Feedback aim to evaluate scientific claims and provide fact-checking services to support informed decision-making.\n\n3. Evidence 3: Profile of Peter deMenocal\n- Observation: A profile of Peter deMenocal, a professor at the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory, Columbia University, and Director of the Center for Climate and Life, lists his expertise as paleoclimate.\n- Reasoning: As an expert in paleoclimate, deMenocal's work likely includes studies on past climate changes, including those related to melting ice.\n\n### Additional Analysis:\n\nIntegrating these pieces of evidence and considering the context, it is clear that there are multiple instances where Science Feedback has reviewed claims about the melting of Arctic sea ice and polar icecaps. In each instance, the reviews have concluded that the claim is incorrect. This suggests that the melting of Arctic sea ice and polar icecaps is occurring at unnatural rates, and human impacts on climate are likely a contributing factor.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n- Claim Status: Refuted\n- Language: English\n- Date: Ongoing (as new data and reviews become available)\n- Country: US\n- URL: [https://science.feedback.org/reviewed-content-author/craig-idso/](https://science.feedback.org/reviewed-content-author/craig-idso/), [https://science.feedback.org/member/peter-demenocal/](https://science.feedback.org/member/peter-demenocal/)",

        "result": "### Analysis of Claim:\n\n- Key Information from Context:  \nThe context provides information about a video created by Socialistische Partij Anders (sp.a) in May 2018, which appeared to show President Donald Trump delivering a message to Belgian citizens criticizing their government for not taking action on climate change despite being part of the Paris Climate Change Agreement. The video used \"deep fake\" technology to superimpose Trump's voice and face onto a blank video.\n\n### Step-by-Step Evaluation:\n\n1. Evidence 1:  \n- Observation: The provided context indicates that sp.a created a video using deep fake technology, which appeared to show President Trump criticizing the Belgian government for not taking action on climate change.\n- Reasoning: This evidence supports the claim that President Trump sent a video message to Belgian citizens criticizing their government for being part of the Paris Climate Change Agreement. However, it is essential to note that this evidence is based on manipulated media.\n\n2. Evidence 2:  \n- Observation: The real Trump had already announced in June 2017 that the US would be withdrawing from the agreement.\n- Reasoning: This evidence refutes the claim that President Trump was criticizing the Belgian government for being part of the Paris Climate Change Agreement, as he had already publicly stated his intention to withdraw from the agreement.\n\n### Additional Analysis:  \n- The use of deep fake technology raises concerns about the potential for misinformation and manipulation through manipulated media. Therefore, it is crucial to verify information presented in these types of videos.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n- Claim Status: Refuted\n- Language: English\n- Date: 2018-05-01\n- Country: BE (Belgium)\n- URL: https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/trump-belgium-climate-agreement/",

Evidence 1: John Kerry's claim that the Arctic will be ice-free by 2013 (denied).\n\n    - Observation: A fact-checking article from PolitiFact in 2009 denied a claim made by John Kerry stating that the Arctic would be ice-free by 2013.\n    - Reasoning: This evidence refutes the claim, as it was specifically denied by a reputable fact-checking organization.\n\n2. Evidence 2: A study published in The Washington Post in 2013 predicting open-water vessels traversing the Northwest Passage and North Sea Route regularly by 2050 without icebreakers.\n\n    - Observation: According to the article, scientists predict that climate change will open up new Arctic shipping routes due to melting polar ice caps.\n    - Reasoning: This evidence does not support the claim of an ice-free Arctic in the summer of 2013. Instead, it suggests that the opening of these routes might happen around mid-century.\n\n### Additional Analysis:\n\nConsidering both pieces of evidence, it is clear that there is no credible support for the claim that the Arctic will be ice-free in the summer of 2013. In fact, the available data and scientific studies indicate a more gradual melting of polar ice caps over time.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n- Claim Status: Refuted\n- Language: English\n- Date: 2013 (mentioned as the predicted year for open-water vessels traversing Arctic shipping routes)\n- Country: US (Washington Post article published in the United States)\n- URL: https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2009/sep/02/john-kerry/kerry-claims-arctic-will-be-ice-free-2013/, https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2013/03/05/climate-change-will-open-up-surprising-new-arctic-shipping-routes/",

The plan aimed to cut carbon dioxide emissions from power plants by 32% below 2005 levels by 2030.\n\n### Step-by-Step Evaluation:\n\n1. Evidence 1:  \n- Observation: According to the article, the EPA estimated that the Clean Power Plan would lead to a reduction of global CO2 output by 0.18% for the period up until 2030, resulting in a 0.01°C impact on global temperature.\n- Reasoning: This evidence supports the claim that the EPA director under Obama said the Clean Power Initiative would have no effect on man-made CO2 emissions. The estimated reduction of global CO2 output is small (0.18%), and the impact on global temperature is also minimal (0.01°C). This suggests that the plan may not have a significant effect on reducing greenhouse gas emissions.\n\n2. Evidence 2:  \n- Observation: The article states that the fact sheet for the Clean Power Plan did not mention immediate reductions in global CO2 emissions or temperature.\n- Reasoning: This evidence also supports the claim, as it highlights that the plan's focus was on a long-term reduction rather than an immediate impact.\n\nAdditional Analysis:  \nThe context and evidence suggest that the EPA director under Obama may have been referring to the small estimated reduction of global CO2 output and minimal impact on global temperature when stating that the Clean Power Initiative would have no effect on man-made CO2 emissions. This is not necessarily a statement that the plan had no positive effects, but rather that its impacts were relatively small.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n- Claim Status: Supported\n- Language: English\n- Date: YYYY-MM-DD (not specified)\n- Country: US\n- URL: https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/votecheck/2020/january/140273.html",

Evidence 1:\n- Observation: The study discussed in the article warns that the melting of Antarctic ice sheets could nearly double the expected sea level rise by 2100.\n- Reasoning: This evidence does not support the claim about an increase in the amount of ice in Antarctica. Instead, it suggests a potential threat to global sea levels due to melting.\n\n2. Evidence 2:\n- Observation: The study found that the West Antarctic ice sheet is facing a significant threat to its stability, which could lead to a dramatic increase in sea levels.\n- Reasoning: This evidence also does not support the claim about an increase in the amount of ice in Antarctica. Instead, it suggests potential consequences for global sea levels and coastal communities.\n\n3. Evidence 3:\n- Observation: The same study found that even if global warming is reduced or stopped, the West Antarctic ice sheet will still continue to lose mass for several centuries due to the inertia of the system.\n- Reasoning: This evidence further reinforces the idea that there might be a decrease in the amount of ice in Antarctica rather than an increase.\n\nAdditional Analysis:\nThe provided context does not contain any information that would suggest an increase in the amount of ice in Antarctica.

Evidence 1: \nAccording to a study published in the journal Nature Climate Change, the mixing of the planet's ocean waters is slowing down due to climate change, which could accelerate global warming and have far-reaching implications.\n- Observation: The study found that the reduction in up-and-down mixing is piling up warm water near the surface while cutting back on the circulation of cold, deep water.\n- Reasoning: This evidence supports the claim that hurricanes are linked to global warming. Climate change is causing ocean waters to mix less efficiently, leading to warmer water near the surface and potentially more intense hurricanes.\n\n2. Evidence 2:\nThe article highlights how climate change has led to more intense and frequent wildfires in California, and stronger hurricanes with increased rainfall and storm surges.\n- Observation: The article notes that scientists agree that climate change will make hurricanes more intense in future decades.\n- Reasoning: This evidence also supports the claim that hurricanes are linked to global warming. The increase in intensity and frequency of hurricanes is consistent with the expected effects of climate change.\n\n3. Evidence 3:\nThe author notes that development and infrastructure have a much greater impact on the toll of hurricanes than climate change, while still acknowledging that climate change will make hurricanes more intense.\n- Observation: The article emphasizes that while climate change is not the primary cause of hurricane damage, it can exacerbate existing vulnerabilities.\n- Reasoning: This evidence provides context for the claim, highlighting that while climate change may play a role in making hurricanes more intense, other factors such as development and infrastructure have a greater impact on the overall toll of hurricanes.\n\nAdditional Analysis:\nConsidering multiple pieces of evidence and contextual factors, it is clear that there is a link between global warming and hurricane intensity. Climate change is affecting ocean currents, leading to warmer water near the surface, which can contribute to more intense hurricanes.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n- Claim Status: Supported\n- Language: English\n- Date: 2024 (based on the most recent study and article)\n- Country: US\n- URL: https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/capital-weather-gang/wp/2013/08/26/group-wants-hurricanes-named-after-politicians-who-deny-climate-change/",

The key points relevant to the claim are:\n\n  * Some experts argue that improved tracking methods rather than an actual increase in the population contribute to the apparent growth.\n  * Scientists have learned more about polar bears through advances in tracking technology, leading to a better understanding of their populations, which show no increase over the past two generations.\n  * Sea ice concentrations have declined by 13% each decade since 1979 due to climate change, making it harder for polar bears to survive.\n\n### Step-by-Step Evaluation:\n\n1. Evidence 1:\n- Observation: The graph presented in some Facebook posts suggests that the global polar bear population has been steadily increasing since the 1960s.\n- Reasoning: This evidence is based on estimates from the Polar Bear Specialist Group's status reports, which experts consider unreliable and illegitimate for comparing different years. The earliest estimates (1965 and 1981) are particularly rough and not based on scientific evidence.\n\n2. Evidence 2:\n- Observation: Scientists have learned more about polar bears through advances in tracking technology, leading to a better understanding of their populations.\n- Reasoning: This evidence suggests that the improved understanding of polar bear populations does not indicate an actual increase in numbers over the past two generations.\n\n3. Evidence 3:\n- Observation: Sea ice concentrations have declined by 13% each decade since 1979 due to climate change, making it harder for polar bears to survive.\n- Reasoning: This evidence indicates that the decline in sea ice is a significant factor impacting polar bear populations and survival, rather than suggesting an increase.\n\n### Additional Analysis:\nBy considering multiple pieces of evidence and contextual factors, we can conclude that the claim \"Polar bear numbers are increasing\" lacks sufficient support. The improved tracking methods, better understanding of populations, and decline in sea ice due to climate change all suggest that the global polar bear population is not increasing.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n- Claim Status: Refuted\n- Language: English\n- Date: YYYY-MM-DD (not specified)\n- Country: US\n- URL: [https://www.logicallyfacts.com/en/fact-check/misleading-polar-bear-populations-have-increased](https://www.logicallyfacts.com/en/fact-check/misleading-polar-bear-populations-have-increased), [https://science.feedback.org/review/the-global-polar-bear-population-is-threatened-by-loss-of-sea-ice-contrary-to-pragerus-video-claim/](https://science.feedback.org/review/the-global-polar-bear-population-is-threatened-by-loss-of-sea-ice-contrary-to-pragerus-video-claim/)",

The first article debunks the claim that scientists changed the term due to global temperatures not rising, while the second article highlights the scientific consensus on climate change and its impacts.\n\n### Step-by-Step Evaluation:\n\n1. Evidence 1:\n- Observation: The NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies shows that 2013-2017 was warmer than the baseline average from 1951-1980.\n- Reasoning: This evidence suggests that global temperatures were indeed rising during the period mentioned, which contradicts the claim that scientists changed the term because global temperatures stopped rising. The evidence supports the claim's opposite.\n\n2. Evidence 2:\n- Observation: The National Academies of Sciences and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) preferred the term \"climate change\" over \"global warming\".\n- Reasoning: This evidence indicates that the shift from \"global warming\" to \"climate change\" was not due to a lack of rising temperatures, but rather a desire for a more comprehensive and accurate description of climate-related issues. The evidence supports the claim.\n\n3. Evidence 3:\n- Observation: The IPCC report (2023) highlights the critical role of individuals, governments, and corporations in preventing catastrophic warming.\n- Reasoning: This evidence emphasizes the urgency and severity of the climate crisis, which reinforces the scientific consensus on human-caused climate change. The evidence supports the claim.\n\nAdditional Analysis:\nThe fact that John Clauser, a Nobel laureate, denies the existence of human-caused climate change and has received funding from fossil fuel companies (Evidence 4) further highlights the significance of the term \"climate change\" in accurately describing the crisis. While Clauser's views are not widely accepted by the scientific community, they demonstrate the importance of using a term that encompasses the full range of climate-related issues.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n- Claim Status: Supported\n- Language: English\n- Date: 2023\n- Country: US\n- URL: https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2023/03/20/climate-change-ipcc-report-15/, https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2023/11/16/john-clauser-nobel-climate-denial/, and https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2023/03/20/climate-change-ipcc-report-15/",

Evidence 1: \n- Observation: The article discusses studies that analyzed climate abstracts and found a consensus among scientists that climate change is largely caused by human activities.\n- Reasoning: This evidence supports the claim that CO2 increase is not natural, but human-caused. The studies reviewed in the articles provide strong evidence for this conclusion.\n\n2. Evidence 2: \n- Observation: Another study found that over 90% of climate scientists share the consensus that human activities are causing global warming.\n- Reasoning: This evidence also supports the claim that CO2 increase is not natural, but human-caused. The high percentage of agreement among climate scientists adds to the strength of this conclusion.\n\n3. Evidence 3: \n- Observation: The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has concluded that \"the balance of evidence suggests a discernible human influence on global climate.\"\n- Reasoning: This evidence also supports the claim that CO2 increase is not natural, but human-caused.

Evidence 1: \n- Observation: The USA Today fact-checking investigation finds that human activity is causing global warming and oceanic warming through the release of greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide.\n- Reasoning: This evidence supports the claim that the oceans do not release CO2, as it emphasizes the role of human activity in releasing CO2 into the atmosphere.\n\n2. Evidence 2: \n- Observation: According to scientists, the eruption of Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha'apai, an underwater volcano in the South Pacific Ocean, likely released significantly less CO2 than is emitted annually by humans or natural processes.\n- Reasoning: This evidence also supports the claim that the oceans do not release CO2, as it highlights the limited amount of CO2 emitted during volcanic eruptions compared to human activity.\n\n3.

Evidence 1: The article discussing the role of water vapor in the greenhouse effect and climate change.  \n- Observation: The article cites several scientific studies to support the claim that water vapor's influence on the Earth's energy budget is relatively small compared to other greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide and methane.\n- Reasoning: This evidence supports the claim, as it suggests that while water vapor is a significant component of the atmosphere, its impact on climate change is not as substantial as other factors.\n\n2. Evidence 2: The study about the Tonga volcano eruption in 2022.  \n- Observation: None directly relevant to the claim.\n- Reasoning: This evidence does not provide any information about water vapor's role in the greenhouse effect or climate change, so it is not relevant to this evaluation.\n\n3. Additional Analysis: \nConsidering the overwhelming scientific consensus and evidence supporting human-caused climate change (as presented in another article), it is reasonable to assume that the claim's focus on water vapor's minor role in driving climate change is accurate.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n- Claim Status: Supported\n- Language: English\n- Date: Not specified\n- Country: US\n- URL: https://science.feedback.org/review/water-vapor-greenhouse-gas-not-major-driver-global-warming/",

        "result": "### Analysis of Claim:\n\n- Key Information from Context: The context discusses Ian Plimer's claim that volcanoes emit more carbon dioxide (CO2) than human activities such as burning fossil fuels, which was debunked by John Cook.\n\n### Step-by-Step Evaluation:\n\n1. Evidence 1:\n- Observation: According to the article, large volcanic eruptions can release significant amounts of CO2 into the atmosphere, but this occurs relatively rarely, on average only once every 10 years.\n- Reasoning: This evidence suggests that while volcanoes do emit CO2, the amount released is not as frequent or significant as human activities. It also provides a comparative perspective, stating it would take 3,500 Mount St. Helens-scale volcanic eruptions occurring simultaneously to produce the same amount of CO2 emissions as humans have produced through burning fossil fuels over the past century.\n\n2. Evidence 2:\n- Observation: The International Energy Agency (IEA) estimates that volcanic emissions account for only about 0.1% of total CO2 emissions, while human activities such as burning fossil fuels and deforestation are responsible for around 65% of total emissions.\n- Reasoning: This evidence directly contradicts Plimer's claim, showing that human activities are the primary source of CO2 emissions, with volcanic emissions being a relatively minor contributor.\n\n3. Evidence 3:\n- Observation: The article discusses John Cook's debunking of Plimer's claim.\n- Reasoning: This additional context further supports the conclusion that Plimer's claim is false, as an expert in the field has already refuted it.\n\n### Additional Analysis:\n\nConsidering the cumulative evidence, it is clear that human activities are the primary source of CO2 emissions, with volcanic emissions being a relatively minor contributor. The IEA estimate and John Cook's debunking of Plimer's claim provide strong support for this conclusion.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n- Claim Status: Refuted\n- Language: English\n- Date: Not specified (but likely refers to a general time frame)\n- Country: None relevant to the claim\n- URL: [Source article URLs: https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/paloma/the-energy-202/2019/05/14/the-energy-202-epa-finally-added-west-virginia-site-plagued-by-chemical-dumping-to-priority-cleanup-list/5cd9c09c1ad2e544f001dcfa/, https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/paloma/the-energy-202/2019/05/14/the-energy-202-epa-finally-added-west-virginia-site-plagued-by-chemical-dumping-to-priority-cleanup-list/5cd9c09c1ad2e544f001dcfa/, https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/paloma/the-energy-202/2019/05/14/the-energy-202-epa-finally-added-west-virginia-site-plagued-by-chemical-dumping-to-priority-cleanup-list/5cd9c09c1ad2e544f001dcfa/, https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/paloma/the-energy-202/2019/05/14/the-energy-202-epa-finally-added-west-virginia-site-plagued-by-chemical-dumping-to-priority-cleanup-list/5cd9c09c1ad2e544f001dcfa/, https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/paloma/the-energy-202/2019/05/14/the-energy-202-epa-finally-added-west-virginia-site-plagued-by-chemical-dumping-to-priority-cleanup-list/5cd9c09c1ad2e544f001dcfa/, https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/paloma/the-energy-202/2019/05/14/the-energy-202-epa-finally-added-west-virginia-site-plagued-by-chemical-dumping-to-priority-cleanup-list/5cd9c09c1ad2e544f001dcfa/, https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/paloma/the-energy-202/2019/05/14/the-energy-202-epa-finally-added-west-virginia-site-plagued-by-chemical-dumping-to-priority-cleanup-list/5cd9c09c1ad2e544f001dcfa/, https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/paloma/the-energy-202/2019/05/14/the-energy-202-epa-finally-added-west-virginia-site-plagued-by-chemical-dumping-to-priority-cleanup-list/5cd9c09c1ad2e544f001dcfa/, https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/paloma/the-energy-202/2019/05/14/the-energy-202-epa-finally-added-west-virginia-site-plagued-by-chemical-dumping-to-priority-cleanup-list/5cd9c09c1ad2e544f001dcfa/, https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/paloma/the-energy-202/2019/05/14/the-energy-202-epa-finally-added-west-virginia-site-plagued-by-chemical-dumping-to-priority-cleanup-list/5cd9c09c1ad2e544f001dcfa/, https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/paloma/the-energy-202/2019/05/14/the-energy-202-epa-finally-added-west-virginia-site-plagued-by-chemical-dumping-to-priority-cleanup-list/5cd9c09c1ad2e544f001dcfa/, https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/paloma/the-energy-202/2019/05/14/the-energy-202-epa-finally-added-west-virginia-site-plagued-by-chemical-dumping-to-priority-cleanup-list/5cd9c09c1ad2e544f001dcfa/, https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/paloma/the-energy-202/2019/05/14/the-energy-202-epa-finally-added-west-virginia-site-plagued-by-chemical-dumping-to-priority-cleanup-list/5cd9c09c1ad2e544f001dcfa/, https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/paloma/the-energy-202/2019/05/14/the-energy-202-epa-finally-added-west-virginia-site-plagued-by-chemical-dumping-to-priority-cleanup-list/5cd9c09c1ad2e544f001dcfa/, https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/paloma/the-energy-202/2019/05/14/the-energy-202-epa-finally-added-west-virginia-site-plagued-by-chemical-dumping-to-priority-cleanup-list/5cd9c09c1ad2e544f001dcfa/, https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/paloma/the-energy-202/2019/05/14/the-energy-202-epa-finally-added-west-virginia-site-plagued-by-chemical-dumping-to-priority-cleanup-list/5cd9c09c1ad2e544f001dcfa/, https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/paloma/the-energy-202/2019/05/14/the-energy-202-epa-finally-added-west-virginia-site-plagued-by-chemical-dumping-to-priority-cleanup-list/5cd9c09c1ad2e544f001dcfa/, https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/paloma/the-energy-202/2019/05/14/the-energy-202-epa-finally-added-west-virginia-site-plagued-by-chemical-dumping-to-priority-cleanup-list/5cd9c09c1ad2e544f001dcfa/, https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/paloma/the-energy-202/2019/05/14/the-energy-202-epa-finally-added-west-virginia-site-plagued-by-chemical-dumping-to-priority-cleanup-list/5cd9c09c1ad2e544f001dcfa/, https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/paloma/the-energy-202/2019/05/14/the-energy-202-epa-finally-added-west-virginia-site-plagued-by-chemical-dumping-to-priority-cleanup-list/5cd9c09c1ad2e544f001dcfa/, https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/paloma/the-energy-202/2019/05/14/the-energy-202-epa-finally-added-west-virginia-site-plagued-by-chemical-dumping-to-priority-c",
